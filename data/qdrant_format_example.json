    "text": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: A very long time ago, my husband and I were invited to dinner at a restaurant by a colleague of his. I had not met the colleague or his wife prior to the dinner.  The men promised they wouldn’t talk shop, but they did -- throughout the entire meal. There was no inclusion of us women. I tried to initiate a conversation with the wife, and she shut me down immediately with something along the lines of, “I’d rather listen to what the men are talking about.” Gobsmacked, I just shrank back in the seat and ate my dinner. As my husband and I were leaving, I told him what had happened and he (rightfully) said that we’d never do that again. I should have gotten over this by now, but I fantasize about having left the table in some way. What should I have done? I didn’t want to be rude myself. GENTLE READER: Are you talking about a very, VERY long time ago? Because Miss Manners remembers those days -- when wives, if invited at all, were treated as table decorations to be talked around.  But didn’t we have a successful rebellion against that?  Apparently not successful enough, if it is now a wife who treats her guest like that. She need only have said, apologetically, “Sorry, I’m listening to them.” There is no need for you to fantasize about reacting effectively, and yet not rudely, because you already did: first by your silence, and then by your and your husband’s resolving never to socialize with them again.  ***\n(Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website,\nwww.missmanners.com\n; to her email,\ndearmissmanners@gmail.com\n; or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)",

    "text": "TORONTO\n—\nJ.C. Escarra\nfeels personally responsible for the\nYankees’ 12-5 loss\nto the Blue Jays on Tuesday, a game-changing catcher’s interference on a check swing.\nYankees\nmanager Aaron Boone blamed the mistake on a rule that he feels MLB ought to change. Reliever Luke Weaver, who allowed five seventh-inning rules immediately after the E2, agrees with his skipper. With two on and one out in the seventh inning of a tie game, the rookie catcher knows that he was too aggressive trying to frame a 3-2 fastball from Luke Weaver that already was a framed strike. Plate umpire Doug Eddings rung up pinch-hitter Addison Barger, but while checking his swing his bat clipped Escarra’s catcher’s mitt. The Blue Jays asked for replay challenge to overturn the strikeout, won and wound up with the bases loaded and one out instead of two on with two down when Escarra was charged with a second catcher’s interference call in two days. “It’s on me,” Escarra said. “I intend to get as close as possible, but obviously not letting that happen. I was too close. I didn’t help my team win today … or yesterday. “It shouldn’t happen, but it’s something I can control. I was just too deep in there trying to steal that strike.” Boone says the Yankees relentlessly prepare to avoid catcher’s interference by knowing which hitters are more prone to hitting a catcher’s mitt with a swing during framing situations. “We’re incredibly diligent on trying to eliminate that as much as possible,” Boone said. “I don’t know how many times it’s happened to us this year in the first three months. “It is something that we lean into every hitter. Who are we vulnerable with? Who are we not? We’ve met and we do that accordingly with our catchers.” What bothered Boone is that this one occurred when Barger didn’t even swing. “We benefited from a check swing last year,” Boone said. “I forget the game, but there should probably be something looked into that where a check swing can’t get you beat like that.” Weaver feels the same. “It’s pretty devastating, honestly,” he said. “I feel like that’s a really unfortunate part of our game. I don’t really personally think that belongs in our game. I think there should be some type of discretion to it. “I understand that there are moments where it’s very egregious and (batters) hit the glove on a full swing, but you feel like you earned something there and it was taken from you and it’s out of my control at that point. “Just a real silly thing to happen.” After it happened, the floodgates opened with the tie-breaking hit by Clement and then the grand slam by Springer, who had a great day going 3-for-4 with two homers and seven RBI. “I’m trying to get the groundball on the next pitch (to Clement) and it just finds the hole, then you run into a bad pitch there a guy that’s having a nice day and the game gets away from you.” The Blue Jays taking over the game after the catcher’s interference sickened Escarra. “Exactly,” he said. “It gave them bases loaded and the big hit came. I could have prevented it, so it was in my control.”\nYankees -1.5 runline is +128 on\nDraftKings\nfor Wednesday’s game against the Blue Jays. Our comprehensive\nDraftKings Sportsbook review\nwill show you how to sign up and get started.\nEscarra says that he’s never had a problem with catcher’s interference calls until the last two days. “No,” he said. “It’s just trying to get the glove in the zone. If the pitch is out of the zone, I’m just trying to move it as fast as possible up and forward to steal that strike, to make it look like a strike to the umpire. “He wasn’t going to swing, but at the end of the day I shouldn’t have been too close like that. “Going forward, I’ve really got to make it a priority to not get in too deep in there.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "On Wednesday at 2:51 a.m. the National Weather Service issued an updated flood warning in effect until 7 a.m. for Monmouth and Ocean counties. The weather service states, \"Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected for portions of central and southern New Jersey, including in central New Jersey, Monmouth counties. In southern New Jersey, Ocean.\" \"Flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations is imminent or occurring,\" explains the weather service. \"Don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\" A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall. A flood warning is declared when flooding is on the verge of happening or is already underway. A flood advisory is released when flooding is not expected to reach a severity level necessitating a warning. Nonetheless, it can still cause considerable inconvenience and, without exercising caution, potentially lead to situations that threaten life and/or property. A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible. Floods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:\nMove to higher ground:\nIf you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.\nFollow evacuation orders:\nIf local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.\nDisconnect utilities and appliances:\nIf time permits, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This precaution minimizes electrical hazards during flooding.\nAvoid basements and submerged areas:\nAvoid basements or rooms submerged in water with electrical outlets or cords. Preventing electrical accidents is crucial.\nSwift evacuation for your safety:\nIf you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.\nStay away from floodwaters:\nNever attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.\nSeek high ground if trapped:\nShould you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services. During heavy rainfall, the risk of flooding is heightened, especially in low-lying and flood-prone regions. Always remember never to drive through water on the road, no matter how shallow it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared. Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes.\nVisibility matters:\nTurn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",
